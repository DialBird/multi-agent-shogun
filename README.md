## What is this?

**multi-agent-shogun** is a system that runs multiple Claude Code instances simultaneously, orchestrating them like a feudal Japanese army.

**Why use it?**
- One command spawns 8 AI workers executing in parallel
- Zero wait time — give your next order while tasks run in the background
- AI remembers your preferences across sessions (Memory MCP)
- Real-time progress on a dashboard

```
        You (上様 / The Lord)
             │
             ▼  Give orders
      ┌─────────────┐
      │   SHOGUN    │  ← Receives your command, delegates instantly
      └──────┬──────┘
             │  YAML + tmux
      ┌──────▼──────┐
      │    KARO     │  ← Distributes tasks to workers
      └──────┬──────┘
             │
    ┌─┬─┬─┬─┴─┬─┬─┬─┐
    │1│2│3│4│5│6│7│8│  ← 8 workers execute in parallel
    └─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┘
         ASHIGARU

## Why Shogun?

Most multi-agent frameworks burn API tokens on coordination. Shogun doesn't.

| | Claude Code `Task` tool | LangGraph | CrewAI | **multi-agent-shogun** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Subagents inside one process | Graph-based state machine | Role-based agents | Feudal hierarchy via tmux |
| **Parallelism** | Sequential (one at a time) | Parallel nodes (v0.2+) | Limited | **8 independent agents** |
| **Coordination cost** | API calls per Task | API + infra (Postgres/Redis) | API + CrewAI platform | **Zero** (YAML + tmux) |
| **Observability** | Claude logs only | LangSmith integration | OpenTelemetry | **Live tmux panes** + dashboard |
| **Skill discovery** | None | None | None | **Bottom-up auto-proposal** |
| **Setup** | Built into Claude Code | Heavy (infra required) | pip install | Shell scripts |

### What makes this different

**Zero coordination overhead** — Agents talk through YAML files on disk. The only API calls are for actual work, not orchestration. Run 8 agents and pay only for 8 agents' work.

**Full transparency** — Every agent runs in a visible tmux pane. Every instruction, report, and decision is a plain YAML file you can read, diff, and version-control. No black boxes.

**Battle-tested hierarchy** — The Shogun → Karo → Ashigaru chain of command prevents conflicts by design: clear ownership, dedicated files per agent, event-driven communication, no polling.

---

## Bottom-Up Skill Discovery

This is the feature no other framework has.

As Ashigaru execute tasks, they **automatically identify reusable patterns** and propose them as skill candidates. The Karo aggregates these proposals in `dashboard.md`, and you — the Lord — decide what gets promoted to a permanent skill.

```
Ashigaru finishes a task
    ↓
Notices: "I've done this pattern 3 times across different projects"
    ↓
Reports in YAML:  skill_candidate:
                     found: true
                     name: "api-endpoint-scaffold"
                     reason: "Same REST scaffold pattern used in 3 projects"
    ↓
Appears in dashboard.md → You approve → Skill created in .claude/commands/
    ↓
Any agent can now invoke /api-endpoint-scaffold
```

Skills grow organically from real work — not from a predefined template library. Your skill set becomes a reflection of **your** workflow.

## Quick Start

### Windows (WSL2)

<table>
<tr>
<td width="60">

**Step 1**

</td>
<td>

📥 **Download the repository**

[Download ZIP](https://github.com/yohey-w/multi-agent-shogun/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract to `C:\tools\multi-agent-shogun`

*Or use git:* `git clone https://github.com/yohey-w/multi-agent-shogun.git C:\tools\multi-agent-shogun`

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**Step 2**

</td>
<td>

🖱️ **Run `install.bat`**

Right-click → "Run as Administrator" (if WSL2 is not installed). Sets up WSL2 + Ubuntu automatically.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**Step 3**

</td>
<td>

🐧 **Open Ubuntu and run** (first time only)

```bash
cd /mnt/c/tools/multi-agent-shogun
./first_setup.sh
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**Step 4**

</td>
<td>

✅ **Deploy!**

```bash
./shutsujin_departure.sh
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### First-time only: Authentication

After `first_setup.sh`, run these commands once to authenticate:

```bash
# 1. Apply PATH changes
source ~/.bashrc

# 2. OAuth login + Bypass Permissions approval (one command)
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
#    → Browser opens → Log in with Anthropic account → Return to CLI
#    → "Bypass Permissions" prompt appears → Select "Yes, I accept" (↓ to option 2, Enter)
#    → Type /exit to quit
```

This saves credentials to `~/.claude/` — you won't need to do it again.

#### Daily startup

Open an **Ubuntu terminal** (WSL) and run:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/tools/multi-agent-shogun
./shutsujin_departure.sh
```

### 📱 Mobile Access (Command from anywhere)

Control your AI army from your phone — bed, café, or bathroom.

**Requirements (all free):**

| Name | In a nutshell | Role |
|------|--------------|------|
| [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) | A road to your home from anywhere | Connect to your home PC from anywhere |
| SSH | The feet that walk that road | Log into your home PC through Tailscale |
| [Termux](https://termux.dev/) | A black screen on your phone | Required to use SSH — just install it |

**Setup:**

1. Install Tailscale on both WSL and your phone
2. In WSL (auth key method — browser not needed):
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
   sudo tailscaled &
   sudo tailscale up --authkey tskey-auth-XXXXXXXXXXXX
   sudo service ssh start
   ```
3. In Termux on your phone:
   ```sh
   pkg update && pkg install openssh
   ssh youruser@your-tailscale-ip
   css    # Connect to Shogun
   ```
4. Open a new Termux window (+ button) for workers:
   ```sh
   ssh youruser@your-tailscale-ip
   csm    # See all 9 panes
   ```

**Disconnect:** Just swipe the Termux window closed. tmux sessions survive — agents keep working.

**Voice input:** Use your phone's voice keyboard to speak commands. The Shogun understands natural language, so typos from speech-to-text don't matter.

**Even simpler:** With ntfy configured, you can receive notifications and send commands directly from the ntfy app — no SSH required.

<summary>❓ <b>What is WSL2? Why is it needed?</b> (click to expand)</summary>

### About WSL2

**WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** lets you run Linux inside Windows. This system uses `tmux` (a Linux tool) to manage multiple AI agents, so WSL2 is required on Windows.

### If you don't have WSL2 yet

No problem! Running `install.bat` will:
1. Check if WSL2 is installed (auto-install if not)
2. Check if Ubuntu is installed (auto-install if not)
3. Guide you through next steps (running `first_setup.sh`)

**Quick install command** (run PowerShell as Administrator):
```powershell
wsl --install
```

Then restart your computer and run `install.bat` again.

<summary>📋 <b>Script Reference</b> (click to expand)</summary>

| Script | Purpose | When to run |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `install.bat` | Windows: WSL2 + Ubuntu setup | First time only |
| `first_setup.sh` | Install tmux, Node.js, Claude Code CLI + Memory MCP config | First time only |
| `shutsujin_departure.sh` | Create tmux sessions + launch Claude Code + load instructions + start ntfy listener | Daily |

### What `install.bat` does automatically:
- ✅ Checks if WSL2 is installed (guides you if not)
- ✅ Checks if Ubuntu is installed (guides you if not)
- ✅ Shows next steps (how to run `first_setup.sh`)

### What `shutsujin_departure.sh` does:
- ✅ Creates tmux sessions (shogun + multiagent)
- ✅ Launches Claude Code on all agents
- ✅ Auto-loads instruction files for each agent
- ✅ Resets queue files for a fresh state
- ✅ Starts ntfy listener for phone notifications (if configured)

**After running, all agents are ready to receive commands!**

</details>

---

### After Setup

Whichever option you chose, **10 AI agents** are automatically launched:

| Agent | Role | Count |
|-------|------|-------|
| 🏯 Shogun | Supreme commander — receives your orders | 1 |
| 📋 Karo | Manager — distributes tasks | 1 |
| ⚔️ Ashigaru | Workers — execute tasks in parallel | 8 |

Two tmux sessions are created:
- `shogun` — connect here to give commands
- `multiagent` — workers running in the background

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Connect to the Shogun

After running `shutsujin_departure.sh`, all agents automatically load their instructions and are ready.

Open a new terminal and connect:

```bash
tmux attach-session -t shogun
```

### Step 2: Give your first order

The Shogun is already initialized — just give a command:

```
Research the top 5 JavaScript frameworks and create a comparison table
```

The Shogun will:
1. Write the task to a YAML file
2. Notify the Karo (manager)
3. Return control to you immediately — no waiting!

Meanwhile, the Karo distributes tasks to Ashigaru workers for parallel execution.

### Step 3: Check progress

Open `dashboard.md` in your editor for a real-time status view:

```markdown
## In Progress
| Worker | Task | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| Ashigaru 1 | Research React | Running |
| Ashigaru 2 | Research Vue | Running |
| Ashigaru 3 | Research Angular | Completed |
```

### Detailed flow

```
You: "Research the top 5 MCP servers and create a comparison table"
```

The Shogun writes the task to `queue/shogun_to_karo.yaml` and wakes the Karo. Control returns to you immediately.

The Karo breaks the task into subtasks:

| Worker | Assignment |
|--------|-----------|
| Ashigaru 1 | Research Notion MCP |
| Ashigaru 2 | Research GitHub MCP |
| Ashigaru 3 | Research Playwright MCP |
| Ashigaru 4 | Research Memory MCP |
| Ashigaru 5 | Research Sequential Thinking MCP |

All 5 Ashigaru research simultaneously. You can watch them work in real time:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/tmux_multiagent_working.png" alt="Ashigaru agents working in parallel" width="700">
</p>

Results appear in `dashboard.md` as they complete.

---

## Key Features

### ⚡ 1. Parallel Execution

One command spawns up to 8 parallel tasks:

```
You: "Research 5 MCP servers"
→ 5 Ashigaru start researching simultaneously
→ Results in minutes, not hours
```

### 🔄 2. Non-Blocking Workflow

The Shogun delegates instantly and returns control to you:

```
You: Command → Shogun: Delegates → You: Give next command immediately
                                       ↓
                       Workers: Execute in background
                                       ↓
                       Dashboard: Shows results
```

No waiting for long tasks to finish.

### 🧠 3. Cross-Session Memory (Memory MCP)

Your AI remembers your preferences:

```
Session 1: Tell it "I prefer simple approaches"
            → Saved to Memory MCP

Session 2: AI loads memory on startup
            → Stops suggesting complex solutions
```

### 📡 4. Event-Driven (Zero Polling)

Agents communicate through YAML files and wake each other with tmux send-keys. **No polling loops wasting API calls.**

### 📸 5. Screenshot Integration

VSCode's Claude Code extension lets you paste screenshots to explain issues. This CLI system provides the same capability:

```yaml
# Set your screenshot folder in config/settings.yaml
screenshot:
  path: "/mnt/c/Users/YourName/Pictures/Screenshots"
```

```
# Just tell the Shogun:
You: "Check the latest screenshot"
You: "Look at the last 2 screenshots"
→ AI instantly reads and analyzes your screen captures
```

**Windows tip:** Press `Win + Shift + S` to take screenshots. Set the save path in `settings.yaml` for seamless integration.

Use cases:
- Explain UI bugs visually
- Show error messages
- Compare before/after states

### 📁 6. Context Management (4-Layer Architecture)

Efficient knowledge sharing through a four-layer context system:

| Layer | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Layer 1: Memory MCP | `memory/shogun_memory.jsonl` | Cross-project, cross-session long-term memory |
| Layer 2: Project | `config/projects.yaml`, `projects/<id>.yaml`, `context/{project}.md` | Project-specific information and technical knowledge |
| Layer 3: YAML Queue | `queue/shogun_to_karo.yaml`, `queue/tasks/`, `queue/reports/` | Task management — source of truth for instructions and reports |
| Layer 4: Session | CLAUDE.md, instructions/*.md | Working context (wiped by `/clear`) |

This design enables:
- Any Ashigaru can work on any project
- Context persists across agent switches
- Clear separation of concerns
- Knowledge survives across sessions

#### /clear Protocol (Cost Optimization)

As agents work, their session context (Layer 4) grows, increasing API costs. `/clear` wipes session memory and resets costs. Layers 1–3 persist as files, so nothing is lost.

Recovery cost after `/clear`: **~6,800 tokens** (42% improved from v1 — CLAUDE.md YAML conversion + English-only instructions reduced token cost by 70%)

1. CLAUDE.md (auto-loaded) → recognizes itself as part of the Shogun System
2. `tmux display-message -t "$TMUX_PANE" -p '#{@agent_id}'` → identifies its own number
3. Memory MCP read → restores the Lord's preferences (~700 tokens)
4. Task YAML read → picks up the next assignment (~800 tokens)

The key insight: designing **what not to load** is what drives cost savings.

#### Universal Context Template

All projects use the same 7-section template:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| What | Project overview |
| Why | Goals and success criteria |
| Who | Stakeholders and responsibilities |
| Constraints | Deadlines, budgets, limitations |
| Current State | Progress, next actions, blockers |
| Decisions | Decisions made and their rationale |
| Notes | Free-form observations and ideas |

This unified format enables:
- Quick onboarding for any agent
- Consistent information management across all projects
- Easy handoff between Ashigaru workers

### 📱 7. Phone Notifications (ntfy)

Two-way communication between your phone and the Shogun — no SSH, no Tailscale, no server needed.

| Direction | How it works |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Phone → Shogun** | Send a message from the ntfy app → `ntfy_listener.sh` receives it via streaming → Shogun processes automatically |
| **Shogun → Phone** | Task completion, failure, or action-needed events trigger push notifications via `scripts/ntfy.sh` |

```
📱 You (from bed)          🏯 Shogun
    │                          │
    │  "Research React 19"     │
    ├─────────────────────────►│
    │    (ntfy message)        │  → Delegates to Karo → Ashigaru work
    │                          │
    │  "✅ cmd_042 complete"   │
    │◄─────────────────────────┤
    │    (push notification)   │
```

**Setup:**
1. Add `ntfy_topic: "shogun-yourname"` to `config/settings.yaml`
2. Install the [ntfy app](https://ntfy.sh) on your phone and subscribe to the same topic
3. `shutsujin_departure.sh` automatically starts the listener — no extra steps

**Notification examples:**

| Event | Notification |
|-------|-------------|
| Command completed | `✅ cmd_042 complete — 5/5 subtasks done` |
| Task failed | `❌ subtask_042c failed — API rate limit` |
| Action required | `🚨 Action needed: approve skill candidate` |
| Streak update | `🔥 3-day streak! 12/12 tasks today` |

Free, no account required, no server to maintain. Uses [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh) — an open-source push notification service.

#### VoiceFlow Notifications

Behavioral psychology-driven motivation through your notification feed:

- **Streak tracking**: Consecutive completion days counted in `voiceflow/streaks.yaml` — maintaining streaks leverages loss aversion to sustain momentum
- **Eat the Frog** 🐸: The hardest task of the day is marked as the "Frog." Completing it triggers a special celebration notification
- **Daily progress**: `12/12 tasks today` — visual completion feedback reinforces the Arbeitslust effect (joy of work-in-progress)

### 🖼️ 8. Pane Border Task Display

Each tmux pane shows the agent's current task directly on its border:

```
┌ ashigaru1 (Sonnet) VF requirements ─┬ ashigaru3 (Opus) API research ──────┐
│                                      │                                     │
│  Working on VoiceFlow requirements   │  Researching REST API patterns      │
│                                      │                                     │
├ ashigaru2 (Sonnet) ─────────────────┼ ashigaru4 (Opus) DB schema design ──┤
│                                      │                                     │

└──────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Working**: `ashigaru1 (Sonnet) VF requirements` — agent name, model, and task summary
- **Idle**: `ashigaru1 (Sonnet)` — model name only, no task
- Updated automatically by the Karo when assigning or completing tasks
- Glance at all 9 panes to instantly know who's doing what

---

## Model Settings

| Agent | Default Model | Thinking | Rationale |
|-------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Shogun | Opus | **Enabled (high)** | Strategic discussions, research, and policy design require deep reasoning. Use `--shogun-no-thinking` to disable for relay-only mode |
| Karo | Opus | Enabled | Task distribution requires careful judgment |
| Ashigaru 1–4 | Sonnet | Enabled | Cost-efficient for standard tasks |
| Ashigaru 5–8 | Opus | Enabled | Full capability for complex tasks |

The Shogun serves as the Lord's strategic advisor — not just a task relay. Strategic discussions, research analysis, and policy design are Bloom's Taxonomy Level 4–6 (analysis, evaluation, creation), requiring Thinking mode enabled. For relay-only use, disable with `--shogun-no-thinking`.

### Battle Formations

| Formation | Ashigaru 1–4 | Ashigaru 5–8 | Command |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Normal** (default) | Sonnet | Opus | `./shutsujin_departure.sh` |
| **Battle** (`-k` flag) | Opus | Opus | `./shutsujin_departure.sh -k` |

Half the squad runs on the cheaper Sonnet model by default. When it's crunch time, switch to Battle formation with `-k` (`--kessen`) for all-Opus maximum capability. The Karo can also promote individual Ashigaru mid-session with `/model opus` when a specific task demands it.

### Bloom's Taxonomy Task Classification

Tasks are classified using Bloom's Taxonomy to optimize model assignment:

| Level | Category | Description | Model |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------|
| L1 | Remember | Recall facts, copy, list | Sonnet |
| L2 | Understand | Explain, summarize, paraphrase | Sonnet |
| L3 | Apply | Execute procedures, implement known patterns | Sonnet |
| L4 | Analyze | Compare, investigate, deconstruct | Opus |
| L5 | Evaluate | Judge, critique, recommend | Opus |
| L6 | Create | Design, build, synthesize new solutions | Opus |

The Karo assigns each subtask a Bloom level and routes it to the appropriate agent tier. This ensures cost-efficient execution: routine work goes to Sonnet, while complex reasoning goes to Opus.

### Task Dependencies (blockedBy)

Tasks can declare dependencies on other tasks using `blockedBy`:

```yaml
# queue/tasks/ashigaru2.yaml
task:
  task_id: subtask_010b
  blockedBy: ["subtask_010a"]  # Waits for ashigaru1's task to complete
  description: "Integrate the API client built by subtask_010a"
```

When a blocking task completes, the Karo automatically unblocks dependent tasks and assigns them to available Ashigaru. This prevents idle waiting and enables efficient pipelining of dependent work.

---

## Philosophy

> "Don't execute tasks mindlessly. Always keep 'fastest × best output' in mind."

The Shogun System is built on five core principles:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Autonomous Formation** | Design task formations based on complexity, not templates |
| **Parallelization** | Use subagents to prevent single-point bottlenecks |
| **Research First** | Search for evidence before making decisions |
| **Continuous Learning** | Don't rely solely on model knowledge cutoffs |
| **Triangulation** | Multi-perspective research with integrated authorization |

These principles are documented in detail: **[docs/philosophy.md](docs/philosophy.md)**

---

## Design Philosophy

### Why a hierarchy (Shogun → Karo → Ashigaru)?

1. **Instant response**: The Shogun delegates immediately, returning control to you
2. **Parallel execution**: The Karo distributes to multiple Ashigaru simultaneously
3. **Single responsibility**: Each role is clearly separated — no confusion
4. **Scalability**: Adding more Ashigaru doesn't break the structure
5. **Fault isolation**: One Ashigaru failing doesn't affect the others
6. **Unified reporting**: Only the Shogun communicates with you, keeping information organized

### Why YAML + send-keys?

1. **State persistence**: YAML files provide structured communication that survives agent restarts
2. **No polling needed**: Event-driven design reduces API costs
3. **No interruptions**: Prevents agents from interrupting each other or your input
4. **Easy debugging**: Humans can read YAML files directly to understand system state
5. **No conflicts**: Each Ashigaru has dedicated files
6. **2-second send intervals**: Adding `sleep 2` between consecutive send-keys prevents input buffer overflow (improved delivery rate from 14% to 87.5%)

### Agent Identification (@agent_id)

Each pane has a `@agent_id` tmux user option (e.g., `karo`, `ashigaru1`). While `pane_index` can shift when panes are rearranged, `@agent_id` is set at startup by `shutsujin_departure.sh` and never changes.

Agent self-identification:
```bash
tmux display-message -t "$TMUX_PANE" -p '#{@agent_id}'
```
The `-t "$TMUX_PANE"` is required. Omitting it returns the active pane's value (whichever pane you're focused on), causing misidentification.

Model names are stored as `@model_name` and current task summaries as `@current_task` — both displayed in the `pane-border-format`. Even if Claude Code overwrites the pane title, these user options persist.

### Why only the Karo updates dashboard.md

1. **Single writer**: Prevents conflicts by limiting updates to one agent
2. **Information aggregation**: The Karo receives all Ashigaru reports, so it has the full picture
3. **Consistency**: All updates pass through a single quality gate
4. **No interruptions**: If the Shogun updated it, it could interrupt the Lord's input

---

## Skills

No skills are included out of the box. Skills emerge organically during operation — you approve candidates from `dashboard.md` as they're discovered.

Invoke skills with `/skill-name`. Just tell the Shogun: "run /skill-name".

### Skill Philosophy

**1. Skills are not committed to the repo**

Skills in `.claude/commands/` are excluded from version control by design:
- Every user's workflow is different
- Rather than imposing generic skills, each user grows their own skill set

**2. How skills are discovered**

```
Ashigaru notices a pattern during work
    ↓
Appears in dashboard.md under "Skill Candidates"
    ↓
You (the Lord) review the proposal
    ↓
If approved, instruct the Karo to create the skill
```

Skills are user-driven. Automatic creation would lead to unmanageable bloat — only keep what you find genuinely useful.

## MCP Setup Guide

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend Claude's capabilities. Here's how to set them up:

### What is MCP?

MCP servers give Claude access to external tools:
- **Notion MCP** → Read and write Notion pages
- **GitHub MCP** → Create PRs, manage issues
- **Memory MCP** → Persist memory across sessions

### Installing MCP Servers

Add MCP servers with these commands:

```bash
# 1. Notion - Connect to your Notion workspace
claude mcp add notion -e NOTION_TOKEN=your_token_here -- npx -y @notionhq/notion-mcp-server

# 2. Playwright - Browser automation
claude mcp add playwright -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest
# Note: Run `npx playwright install chromium` first

# 3. GitHub - Repository operations
claude mcp add github -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_pat_here -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github

# 4. Sequential Thinking - Step-by-step reasoning for complex problems
claude mcp add sequential-thinking -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking

# 5. Memory - Cross-session long-term memory (recommended!)
# ✅ Auto-configured by first_setup.sh
# To reconfigure manually:
claude mcp add memory -e MEMORY_FILE_PATH="$PWD/memory/shogun_memory.jsonl" -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

### Verify installation

```bash
claude mcp list
```

All servers should show "Connected" status.

## Real-World Use Cases

This system manages **all white-collar tasks**, not just code. Projects can live anywhere on your filesystem.

### Example 1: Research sprint

```
You: "Research the top 5 AI coding assistants and compare them"

What happens:
1. Shogun delegates to Karo
2. Karo assigns:
   - Ashigaru 1: Research GitHub Copilot
   - Ashigaru 2: Research Cursor
   - Ashigaru 3: Research Claude Code
   - Ashigaru 4: Research Codeium
   - Ashigaru 5: Research Amazon CodeWhisperer
3. All 5 research simultaneously
4. Results compiled in dashboard.md
```

### Example 2: PoC preparation

```
You: "Prepare a PoC for the project on this Notion page: [URL]"

What happens:
1. Karo fetches Notion content via MCP
2. Ashigaru 2: Lists items to verify
3. Ashigaru 3: Investigates technical feasibility
4. Ashigaru 4: Drafts a PoC plan
5. All results compiled in dashboard.md — meeting prep done
```

---

## Configuration

### Language

```yaml
# config/settings.yaml
language: ja   # Samurai Japanese only
language: en   # Samurai Japanese + English translation
```

### Screenshot integration

```yaml
# config/settings.yaml
screenshot:
  path: "/mnt/c/Users/YourName/Pictures/Screenshots"
```

Tell the Shogun "check the latest screenshot" and it reads your screen captures for visual context. (`Win+Shift+S` on Windows.)

### ntfy (Phone Notifications)

```yaml
# config/settings.yaml
ntfy_topic: "shogun-yourname"
```

Subscribe to the same topic in the [ntfy app](https://ntfy.sh) on your phone. The listener starts automatically with `shutsujin_departure.sh`.

## Project Management

This system manages not just its own development, but **all white-collar tasks**. Project folders can be located outside this repository.

### How it works

```
config/projects.yaml          # Project list (ID, name, path, status only)
projects/<project_id>.yaml    # Full details for each project
```

- **`config/projects.yaml`**: A summary list of what projects exist
- **`projects/<id>.yaml`**: Complete details (client info, contracts, tasks, related files, Notion pages, etc.)
- **Project files** (source code, documents, etc.) live in the external folder specified by `path`
- **`projects/` is excluded from git** (contains confidential client information)

### Example

```yaml
# config/projects.yaml
projects:
  - id: client_x
    name: "Client X Consulting"
    path: "/mnt/c/Consulting/client_x"
    status: active

# projects/client_x.yaml
id: client_x
client:
  name: "Client X"
  company: "X Corporation"
contract:
  fee: "monthly"
current_tasks:
  - id: task_001
    name: "System Architecture Review"
    status: in_progress
```

This separation lets the Shogun System coordinate across multiple external projects while keeping project details out of version control.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Using npm version of Claude Code CLI?</b></summary>

The npm version (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`) is officially deprecated. Re-run `first_setup.sh` to detect and migrate to the native version.

```bash
# Re-run first_setup.sh
./first_setup.sh

# If npm version is detected:
# ⚠️ npm version of Claude Code CLI detected (officially deprecated)
# Install native version? [Y/n]:

# After selecting Y, uninstall npm version:
npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>MCP tools not loading?</b></summary>

MCP tools are lazy-loaded. Search first, then use:
```
ToolSearch("select:mcp__memory__read_graph")
mcp__memory__read_graph()
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Agents asking for permissions?</b></summary>

Agents should start with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. This is handled automatically by `shutsujin_departure.sh`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Workers stuck?</b></summary>

```bash
tmux attach-session -t multiagent
# Ctrl+B then 0-8 to switch panes
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Agent crashed?</b></summary>

**Do NOT use `css`/`csm` aliases to restart inside an existing tmux session.** These aliases create tmux sessions, so running them inside an existing tmux pane causes session nesting — your input breaks and the pane becomes unusable.

**Correct restart methods:**

```bash
# Method 1: Run claude directly in the pane
claude --model opus --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Method 2: Karo force-restarts via respawn-pane (also fixes nesting)
tmux respawn-pane -t shogun:0.0 -k 'claude --model opus --dangerously-skip-permissions'
```

**If you accidentally nested tmux:**
1. Press `Ctrl+B` then `d` to detach (exits the inner session)
2. Run `claude` directly (don't use `css`)
3. If detach doesn't work, use `tmux respawn-pane -k` from another pane to force-reset

</details>

## tmux Quick Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `tmux attach -t shogun` | Connect to the Shogun |
| `tmux attach -t multiagent` | Connect to workers |
| `Ctrl+B` then `0`–`8` | Switch panes |
| `Ctrl+B` then `d` | Detach (agents keep running) |
| `tmux kill-session -t shogun` | Stop the Shogun session |
| `tmux kill-session -t multiagent` | Stop the worker session |

### Mouse Support

`first_setup.sh` automatically configures `set -g mouse on` in `~/.tmux.conf`, enabling intuitive mouse control:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Mouse wheel | Scroll within a pane (view output history) |
| Click a pane | Switch focus between panes |
| Drag pane border | Resize panes |

Even if you're not comfortable with keyboard shortcuts, you can switch, scroll, and resize panes using just the mouse.
